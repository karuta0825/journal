`with-redefs` を使って関数を再定義すればよい。  
この関数内では別の関数に差し替えてくれる。

```clojure
(defn today
  []
  (t/today))


(defn one-year-ago
  ([] (one-year-ago (today)))
  ([date] (t/minus date (t/years 1))))


(defn yesterday
  []
  (t/minus (today) (t/days 1)))


(deftest date-calculations-with-redefs
  (with-redefs [t/today (fn [] (t/local-date 2016 1 10))]
    (testing "1 year age"
      (are [exp actual] (= exp actual)
        (t/local-date 2015 1 10) (one-year-ago)
        (t/local-date 2015 1 1) (one-year-ago (t/local-date 2016 1 1))))

    (testing "yesterday"
      (is (= (t/local-date 2016 1 9) (yesterday))))))
```
